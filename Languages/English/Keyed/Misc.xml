  <RA_GameStartDialog>     Somewhere in the deep space, far from magnificent Glitterworlds, a slave ship, full of its recent catch, had been orbiting an isolated planet.\n\n     No one knows, what caused the explosion in the cargo deck, but in a moment the ship was torn apart. Those few slavers, who survived the explosion, tried to find resque in the escape pods, but the emergency systems failure lead to automatic prerelease of those pods. Scattered ship parts crashed far away from each other onto the planet surface, killing everyone who were awake inside.\n\n     Nevertheless, some of the slaves, sleeping in the prisoner cryptosleep caskets, managed to survive the impact and awake from their slumber. They had no idea where they are, how far away from home they've been taken, or if they ever will get back again. As the debris settles, they trudge out onto the foreign land, and begin their survival in this harsh Rimworld.</RA_GameStartDialog>
